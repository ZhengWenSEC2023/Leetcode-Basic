- Solution:

    Given a list of arrays, we want to find the maximum distance between two arrays (one offers the minimum and the other offers the maximum). An intuitive way is that we find the minimum value from the **0st** element of the arrays and the maximum value from the **last** element of the arrays, but the problem requires us to find this two value from **two different arrays**. So, once we make use of one array as the source of the maximum value, the minimum value must comes from another other array. So, there are two situations, one is that we first select the maximum value from an array, and find the minimum value from the other array, another is that we first select the minimum value fron an array and find the maximum value from the other array, and we return the maximum difference of this two situations. 

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxDistance(self, arrays: List[List[int]]) -> int:
            MAXIMUM = 1000000
            min_min = MAXIMUM
            min_max = -MAXIMUM
            min_minarray = -1
            max_min = MAXIMUM
            max_max = -MAXIMUM
            max_maxarray = -1
            
            for idx, array in enumerate(arrays):
                if array[0] < min_min:
                    min_minarray = idx
                    min_min = array[0]
                if array[-1] > max_max:
                    max_maxarray = idx
                    max_max = array[-1]
                    
            for idx, array in enumerate(arrays):
                if idx != min_minarray and array[-1] > min_max:
                    min_max = array[-1]
                if idx != max_maxarray and array[0] < max_min:
                    max_min = array[0]
                    
            return max(abs(min_min - min_max), abs(max_min - max_max))
    ```

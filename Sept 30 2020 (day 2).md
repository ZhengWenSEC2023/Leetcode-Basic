- Solution: 

    Given an array with **length = n**, the largest number should not exceed **n** and not smaller than **1**, so we could first set all this kind of words into **1**, then all of the numbers in the array should lies in **[1, n]**. Because this problem requires us do not use additional memory, we need to find out a way to store whether each value appear in this array or not. An intuitive way is that we use a set to store each number, and then we traverse this set to find out the missing number. So here, because the number inside this array lies in **[1, n]**, we could make use of the sign of each number to store this. Then we find the corresponding positive number, which is the answer.

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            n = len(nums)
            
            if 1 not in nums:
                return 1
            
            if n == 1:
                return 2
            
            for i in range(n):
                if nums[i] <= 0 or nums[i] > n:
                    nums[i] = 1
            
            for i in range(n):
                a = abs(nums[i])
                
                if a == n:
                    nums[0] = -abs(nums[0])
                else:
                    nums[a] = -abs(nums[a])
            
            for i in range(1, n):
                if nums[i] > 0:
                    return i
            
            if nums[0] > 0:
                return n
            
            return n + 1
    ```

Remove Covered Intervals (**MEDIUM**)

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-covered-intervals/

- Solution:  Greedy Algorithm

    Keep track of the best solution each step, then get the global optimal solution. First sort the input intervals, first we want to find the lowest bound of the whole interval, so sort the intervals by the lower bound in ascending order. If the two intervals have the same starting point, then sort by the descending order of the end point, so that the first interval of with the same starting point would be the longest interval in these intervals. After the sorting, we could keep tracking of the lower bound and the higher bound of current interval. We could separate the situations to two. One is that the intervals overlap with each other, where the inclusive situations are also included, in this situation, because we have sorted the intervals, we do not need to change the lower bound of the intervals, we only need to change the higher bound to the larger one. The other one is that the intervals is not overlap with each other, where we need to change the current lower bound and the higher bound to the one with both larger for we have sorted the intervals in this way: The later ones must have the starting point larger than the end point of the previous interval if these two do not overlap with each other. We could store the corresponding lower bound and upper bound by two pointers pointing to the corresponding interval, then we store all of the intervals into a vector, then traverse all of the intervals, return the length of the storage.

    ```CPP
    class Solution {
    public:
        int removeCoveredIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
            if (intervals.size() == 0)
            {
                return 0;
            }
            
            sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](vector<int> v1, vector<int> v2)
                {
                    if (v1.at(0) < v2.at(0))
                        return true;
                    else if (v1.at(0) > v2.at(0))
                        return false;
                    else
                    {
                        if (v1.at(1) > v2.at(1))
                            return true;
                        else
                            return false;
                    }
                });
            
            vector<vector<int>> res;
            int curr_low = 0, curr_up = 0;
            for (auto interval : intervals)
            {
                if (res.size() == 0)
                {
                    res.push_back(interval);
                    continue;
                }
                
                if (interval.at(0) < res.at(curr_up).at(1) && interval.at(1) <= res.at(curr_up).at(1))
                    continue;
                else if (interval.at(0) < res.at(curr_up).at(1) && interval.at(1) > res.at(curr_up).at(1))
                {
                    res.push_back(interval);
                    curr_up++;
                }
                else
                {
                    res.push_back(interval);
                    curr_up++;
                    curr_low = curr_up;
                }
            }
            return res.size();
        }
    };
    ```

    If we do not want to use the res as the vector, we could only use a number: 

    ```CPP
    class Solution {
    public:
        int removeCoveredIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
            if (intervals.size() == 0)
                return 0;
            
            sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](vector<int> v1, vector<int> v2)
                {
                    if (v1.at(0) < v2.at(0))
                        return true;
                    else if (v1.at(0) > v2.at(0))
                        return false;
                    else
                    {
                        if (v1.at(1) > v2.at(1))
                            return true;
                        else
                            return false;
                    }
                });
            
            int res = 1;
            int curr_low = 0, curr_up = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < intervals.size(); i++)
            {
                
                if (intervals.at(i).at(0) < intervals.at(curr_up).at(1) && intervals.at(i).at(1) <= intervals.at(curr_up).at(1))
                    continue;
                else if (intervals.at(i).at(0) < intervals.at(curr_up).at(1) && intervals.at(i).at(1) > intervals.at(curr_up).at(1))
                {
                    res++;
                    curr_up = i;
                }
                else
                {
                    res++;
                    curr_up = i;
                }
            }
            return res;
        }
    };
    ```

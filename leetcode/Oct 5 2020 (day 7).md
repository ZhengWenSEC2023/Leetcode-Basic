Complement of Base 10 Integer

https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

- Solution 1:

    Just convert the decimal into binary. Then flip every bit, then convert back.

    ```Python
    class Solution:
        def findComplement(self, N: int) -> int:
            if N == 0:
                return 1
            
            binary = ''
            while N > 0:
                binary += str(1 - N % 2)
                N = N // 2
            binary = binary[::-1]
            
            res = 0
            for i in range(len(binary)):
                res += 2 ** (len(binary) - i - 1) * int(binary[i])
            
            return res
    ```

- Solution 2:

    Make use of bit mask then flip every bit by XOR operation with 1. 

    ```Python
    class Solition:
        def findComplement(self, N: int) -> int:
            """
            todo is the variable denoting which bit we are currently inverting. Also used as a condition to the while loop. 
            bit is the bit mask used to take XOR operation.
            """
            todo, bit = num, 1

            while todo:
                num = num ^ bit
                bit = bit << 1
                todo = todo >> 1
            return num
    ```

- Solution 3:

    Construct a whole bit mask which is with the same length of the input nums. To compute the number of bits of the number, we could make use of log operation.

    ```Python
    from math import log2
    class Solution:
        def findComplement(self, N: int) -> int:
            n = floor(log2(N)) + 1
            bitmask = (1 << n) - 1
            return N ^ bitmask
    ```

- Solution 4:

    highestOneBit OpenJDK algorithm from Hacker's Delight:

    Propragate the highest bit to the end of the number. Because the input is a int, so there is at most 16 bits in the integer. So we could only propragate 16 to the back.

    E.g.

    - N: 1000001
    - bitmask 0: 1000001
    - bitmask 1 ( >> 1 ): 0100000 | 1000001 = 1100001
    - bitmask 2 ( >> 2 ): 0011000 | 1100001 = 1111001
    - bitmask 3 ( >> 4 ): 0000111 | 1111001 = 1111111
    - ...
    
    ```Python
    class Solution:
        def findComplement(self, N: int) -> int:
            bitmask = N
            bitmask |= (bitmask >> 1)
            bitmask |= (bitmask >> 2)
            bitmask |= (bitmask >> 4)
            bitmask |= (bitmask >> 8)
            bitmask |= (bitmask >> 16)
            return bitmask ^ N
    ```
